Developed by Tom C. 2011~2014, MIT License 



These are two Expression Evaluators modeled after the C programming langauge and  Lisp programming language.  They were originally designed to be a hosted within an application where expressions could be stored as strings to be evaluated latter.  

The demo project includes 2 UI's: ExpressionEvaluatiorWinForms.exe (WinForms) & ExpressionEvaluatorWPF.exe (WPF). Both UI's work with either evaluator (C / Lisp). 


Download and uppack "ExpressionEvaluators.zip" for binaries.  They can be run from folder with Dll's without install.
